I get inexplicably sad on airplanes sometimes. It sets in in the moments between the flight attendants' valiant efforts to engage the passengers with the obligatory safety demonstrations and the plane's unsteady lurch away from its sheet-metal umbilical cord into line with its litter of sheet-metal kin waiting to take off. Looking out of a tiny portal into the vastness of the sky, I can't help but feel that I've signed on with something far bigger than myself—that soon I'll be flung across that great expanse in the belly of a creature that I neither understand nor have power over. I'll watch as the wings of my great fiery steed carry me—safely, reliably, and inexorably—towards my destination.
