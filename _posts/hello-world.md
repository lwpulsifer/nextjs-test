Hi! Welcome to the very first edition of my personal blog (some scattered [blogging from India](https://indoreadventures.wordpress.com/) in 2015-2016 not included). If you've made it here, you hopefully already know who I am and what I'm about, but if not, check out the [home page](/) of this site.

Blogs (and, I suppose, personal websites) are funny things. On the one hand, they're supremely self-indulgent. It's hard to imagine a more extraneous exercise than public, long-form, personal writing purely for the fun of it. On the other hand, when you get down to brass tacks (had to Google [that expression](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/get_down_to_brass_tacks)—I always want to write "brass tax"), answering the "why?" question for most writing is difficult to do. Followed to its logical conclusion, "Why write this?" turns quickly into "Why write?" and then takes a sharply nihilist turn to "Why create at all?". Blogs at least dispose of the comforting illusion that those questions have been answered, and once you liberate yourself from needing to justify *why* you write, you can just do it.

With all of that said, I'll be treating this experiment as an extended attempt to figure out why it is that I'm feeling like writing a blog right now. Some ideas that have occurred to me so far are as follows:
- I miss writing. Since I graduated college in the spring of 2020, I haven't had to write more than a paragraph or two at a time, and I miss the process of converting the contents of my own brain into something that can be seen, read, and understood by other people.
- I want a place to record some of the things I've learned in the last year and a half of work as a software engineer.
- I have some thoughts that I want to put out into the world, and this feels like a low-stakes place to do so.
- I hope that regular writing might help mend my increasingly confused relationship with time (details to come in a future post, I think).
 
Anyway, I'll leave it to you, oh reader to determine if this thing I'm doing is worthwhile. All I know is that I feel like writing, and I'm hoping to do it more regularly.

What kinds of things will I write about? A list of topics might include, but certainly isn't limited to: writing, reading, books, movies, software engineering, programming languages, surfing, rock-climbing, running, politics, romance, philosophy, and NBA basketball. You can expect personal essays, short-to-medium-length fiction, the occasional poem—maybe some visual art or music if I'm feeling especially frisky. Oh, and a whole lot of em-dashes (you're damn right I'm one of those people). I'll try to get something down once a week, with no guarantees on quantity or quality. Read at your own risk, though I suspect the only risk you'll be running is boredom or at worst, mild annoyance.
