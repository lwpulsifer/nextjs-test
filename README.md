This is my personal website, made with NextJS, Typescript, Tailwind CSS, and Webpack 5. This site is under active development and may have crippling bugs. View at your own risk!

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
